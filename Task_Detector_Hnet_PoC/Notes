Notes Experiments:

Experiment 1: Datasets in order from baseline to offset perturbation. All data used, each dataset divided into 2 subsets (only first half and second half).
Experiment 2: Same but shuffled data.
Experiment 3: Same as 2, not interesting.
Experiment 4: None.
Experiment 5:Shuffled data, different order than experiment 2.
Experiment 6:Shuffled data, different order than experiment 2 and 5.
# here modified generate_sim_data_v2 to put task 1 to be mix of removed and shuffled neurons and gain and offset to 60% instead of 50. 
#Changed shuffled to 50% instead of 60.
