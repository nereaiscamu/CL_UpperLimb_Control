# CL_UpperLimb_Control
Github repository for my Master Thesis. The project consists on using cortical neural data to build models and predict upper-limb movement (positions). Continual Learning is implemented to adapt the decoders to spinal cord stimulation. Project done at Sinthlab (UDeM, Mila), co-supervised at EPFL.
